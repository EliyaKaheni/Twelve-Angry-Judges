# Project: Twelve Angry Judges Game

**Overview:**  
The "Twelve Angry Judges" game is an interactive simulation where a user (player) assumes the role of a defendant. They must navigate a courtroom scenario with twelve judges, each with unique personalities, questions, and biases. The user’s goal is to answer the questions posed by the judges in a way that convinces them of their innocence. The game integrates AI to generate judge questions and response options and includes a verdict confidence meter to indicate the likelihood of guilt based on user responses.
