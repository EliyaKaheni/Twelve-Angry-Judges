# Project: Twelve Angry Judges Game

**Overview:**  
The "Twelve Angry Judges" game is an interactive simulation where a user (player) assumes the role of a defendant. They must navigate a courtroom scenario with twelve judges, each with unique personalities, questions, and biases. The user’s goal is to answer the questions posed by the judges in a way that convinces them of their innocence. The game integrates AI to generate judge questions and response options and includes a verdict confidence meter to indicate the likelihood of guilt based on user responses.

## User Stories for Requirements
New users must be able to create an account if they do not have one already, otherwise, they can easily and securely log into their accounts. 
When they start the game they must describe the court case. Each judge will have a distinct AI-generated personality, for the court simulation experience to be varied and realistic. After a short intro, judges will ask questions that challenge the user’s story and keep the game engaging and interesting. 
Users must respond to the questions and their defenses directly influence the court's perception of their characters. Meanwhile, they can see the real-time confidence meter to track the judges’ opinions about their guilt. 
After answering the questions, users can observe a deliberation phase where judges discuss the case. Each judge thinks and talks distinctly according to their personality. After the deliberation, the final verdict will be announced, and the course of the game will end.
